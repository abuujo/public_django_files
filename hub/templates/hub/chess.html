	<h1><strong>The AI basic's</strong></h1>
	<p>The program uses <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta">alpha-beta</a>, a well-known chess
		algorithm. In chess, there are several moves that can be made per turn that would be considered legal or moves
		that follow the rules of the game. Once we have a method of finding these moves (imagine a list of possible
		moves a player can make on a turn), we can then pick one move from said list. This move if made would change the
		state of the board, and the player who is up to move. We can repeat this process, and one concept to keep in
		mind is that imagine we considered four moves, this would be a <em>depth</em> of four. After only a few moves,
		the total number of possible moves to be considered is exponential, and usually too much for a javascript chess
		engine to handle.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Because of this, we use alpha-beta pruning to trim moves that wouldn't make sense to make. let's say that it was
		whites' turn to move, they would need to consider what would look like a decision tree. This tree would have
		layers for each depth layer the algorithm would explore, and branches for every legal move that the algorithm
		could make. Examining one move, we can see that maybe every possible move black could make in response would
		result in an even position (either no material lost on either side or equal exchange of material). Then we
		consider another move and check blacks possible counter moves to it. If on this move we see that one move could
		result in black taking a piece for free, we wouldn't consider it a good move (this would be a negative
		position). Thus we prune off this move since we know we can achieve at least an even game with move one. As the
		simulation goes deeper in-depth, this can become quite hard to keep track of.&nbsp;</p>
	<h1><strong>A small note on directions</strong></h1>
	<p>A standard chess board is 8x8 or 64 squares large. For the purposes of this chess game, on the back end, we
		define it as 10x12. (10 files and 12 ranks). This is so that we can account for out-of-bounds conditions more
		easily. With this information, we can start to look at what directions or moves a piece can make in its turn,
		which can be represented by an array of numbers. consider on an 8x8 board, a pawn can only move in one direction
		which is straight ahead (it can attack in two diagonal positions). If the pawn was on the (file, rank) of (a,2)
		and we wanted to move it to (a,3) this would move it up on rank. since the board is represented as a
		1-dimensional array of 64 places this would advance the pawn 8 places, since a2 would be the 8th place in the
		index (starting at 0, with h being 7th). The pawn would move to 16th place in the index.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This same concept can be used in the 10x12 array just by changing some numbers to get the right direction:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Available directions a piece can move:
kings directions = [-1, -10, 1, 10, -9, -11, 9, 11]        // straight and diagonal
rooks directions = [-1, -10, 1, 10]                        // straight
bishop directions = [-9, -11, 9, 11]                       // diagonal
Kinght directions = [-8, -19, -21, -12, 8, 19, 21, 12 ]    // Up two and across one</code></pre>
	<p>The queen would copy the king's directions and the pawns can be hardcoded.&nbsp;</p>
	<h1><strong>Understanding the legal move list</strong></h1>
	<p>One critical element of this is understanding how the chess engine finds for a player to move, which moves they
		can make. This is a relatively simple algorithm to implement, and I'll write some pseudo-code to explain how it
		works:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>Side to move:
   for each piece:
      if this pieces square + 10 is empty:
         if this pieces square + 20 is empty and pawn on rank 2 / 7:
            add pawn starter move
         Add a pawn quiet move

      if this pieces square + 9 or + 11 have an opponents piece on it:
         add a pawn capture move

      if side to move can castle and no pieces between castle and king
         add a castle move // can be KQkq

      sq = pieces square
      // Note that here the move we get in the loop is say + 10 or -11
      for each direction in piece directions // the array
         target square = sq + direction
         while the square is not off-board
            if square at piece square + move has an opponent piece on it
               add a capture move
            else
               add a quiet move

            target square += direction // add direction again to square</code></pre>
	<p>This algorithm would be run at every layer of depth to determine a list of legal moves. Note that this isn't the
		alpha-beta algorithm, which is applied to this to trim down this list to only moves that make sense to
		consider.&nbsp;</p>
	<h1><strong>Fen notation (Forsyth Edwards Notation)</strong></h1>
	<p>Fen notation (as you can see above the chessboard) is a string of letters and characters that are used to
		represent a board state. To get a starting idea, let's break down the starting position in fen notation (note
		that the different sections are separated by a space):</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1</code></pre>
	<p>The first section gives us "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR". This is simple to understand, r
		represents the rook, n the knight (since k is for king), b for bishop, q for queen, k for king, and p for pawn.
		The letters are placed together in the same order as they would appear on the board, with the rook next to the
		knight and so on forming the 'rank' of the board. there are 8 ranks to a chessboard, and in FEN, they are
		separated with the '/' character. Inside each rank, from left to right are the 'files' from a to h. Whites'
		pieces are upper case while blacks are lower case. there are four ranks in between them represented with the
		number 8. which means that there are 8 empty files on that rank. let's take another rank: '/R4p2/', on this
		rank, file a has the white rook, and file f has the black pawn. we can see that there are four empty ranks
		between the rook and the pawn, and two more empty files on g and h.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The next section contains a 'w' which indicates that white is to move. Black would move if b was in place
		here.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>KQkq indicates which side can still castle. Note that movie one rook or one king can permanently remove the
		ability to castle. There are two castle opportunities for each side, the king side castle (casting with the rook
		closest to the king) and the queen side castle. for white, this is represented as KQ and kq for black. if no
		side could castle this section would be '-'. If a bishop or another piece temporarily blocks this (either by
		putting the king in check or attacking any square in between or the rook itself) the symbols still stay, and are
		only removed when the move is no longer possible.</p>
	<p>The en passant target, when none is available, is represented with '-'. Since no side can en passant at the start
		it is included in the starting position.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The next section is the half move clock (the number of half moves (both people moving would be a full move) since
		a pawn advanced or a piece was captured). This section is used to track the 50 move rule, which dictates that
		after 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, the next player can claim a draw.</p>
	<p>The last section is the number of full moves (white then black increments it by 1). I.e. it moves up one after
		black finished a move.&nbsp;</p>
