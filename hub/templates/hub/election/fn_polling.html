<h4 id="preface"><strong>Australia's 2019 Election</strong></h4>
<p>In the leadup to the 2019 election, many saw the ALP as having an 'unlosable' position. If you <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_Australian_federal_election">followed the
        polling</a> you would have seen a large two party preferred (tpp) gap (although shrinking over time) in their
    favour.
    Following the methadology of Meckerras, many marginal seats would have been won by the ALP. The 2019 election showed
    that the opposite
    happened, with the LNP increasing its seats by 1 (note that that is of the 2016 election, but in the leadup to the
    2019 election the re-districting placed the LNP at 73
    seats to the ALP's 72).</p>

<div id="pollvselec"></div>

<h4 id="preface"><strong>Data vs Election Result</strong></h4>
<p>The above graph shows the polling numbers for the three major parties in the year leading up to the 2019 election.
    Let's consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The primary vote from the 2019 election was broken down like this: lnp: 41.44%, alp: 33.34%, and grn: 10.4%.
    </li>
    <li>LNP: lnp's area at the end of the polling period was between 35.47 to 41.29.</li>
    <li>ALP: alp's area at the end of the polling period was between 31.97 to 40.43.</li>
    <li>GRN: grn's area at the end of the polling period was between 7.20 to 14.39.</li>
</ul><br />
<p>For the two major parties, we can see a pretty big mismatch. Ideally, we want the polling to place the results of the
    actual election closer to the trend line of the graph, not towards (or outside of) the confidence interval
    endpoints. From the comparison we know two things: firstly that the polls under-represent the lnp and over-represent
    the alp (since the lnp overperformed their polls, and the alp underperformed).</p>

<p>It would be incorrect to simply give the lnp a +n to every poll and the alp a -n, but there are methods to try to
    make the graph more accurate. Note that the goal is not to bring the polling
    in-line with the election results, but to weight consistant outliers and determine if a weighted tracker is more
    accurate than an unweighted one. If we try to force the polling to match the election results, it would probably
    prove worthless when applied to the 2022 tracker (which is the goal).</p>
