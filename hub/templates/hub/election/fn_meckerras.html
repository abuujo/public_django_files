<h4 id="preface"><strong>Preface </strong></h4>
<p>The numbers you see in the primary tracker are most likely inaccurate. Whilst I do believe the tracker represents
    trends (i.e. a move toward or away from a particular party), in general the numbers are going to be offset from the
    actual national trend. For a more detailed understanding of how this plays out, check out the first footnote.</p>
<h4 id="primary_vote_title"><strong>Primary Vote</strong></h4>
<p>The primary vote in an Australian election showcases the votes people place as their number 1 preferred party.
    Typically people will cast a ballot with several parties listed with a box next to them. People will write a number
    1-n for n parties in order of preference. The polling here attempts to show where the voting intentions of
    Australians are at the time of the poll.</p>

<h4 id="tpp_vote_title"><strong>Two Party Preferred</strong></h4>
<p>The two-party preferred vote represents the tally once all preferences have been accounted for. On the ballot, people
    may have put a party as their number 1 preference, but would not have received enough votes. When this happens, the
    ballot moves on to the number two and so on until it winds up as one of the two parties left (typically the
    Coalition (Liberal or National party) and Labor). On a national stage, the two-party preferred vote showcases the
    run-off of each party and is an interesting stat to look for towards the federal election.</p>

<h4 id="meckerras_title"><strong>Predictions Using The Mackerras Pendulum</strong></h4>
<p>Now that we have our Two Party Preferred number for the election, we can see the projected outcome on the Meckerras
    Pendulum. The pendulum is conceptually simple. In the lower house there exists some seats which are "safer" than
    others.
    For example, the division of Maranoa in Queensland is held on to by the liberals with 72.49% (2019 election) giving
    the liberals a massive lead. However, the division of Bass is held on to with a 50.41% lead. Bass is considered a
    marginal seat where as Maranoa is deep inside the safe category.</p>

<p>During an election, the Mackerras pendulum theory states that a swing in the two party preferred vote will uniformly
    distribute itself across the seats, and thus if there are 10 seats under a 1.5% swing threshold, with 5 on one side
    and 5 on the other, you would expect a 1.5% swing in the TPP vote to even out to one side gaining 5 seats from the
    other.</p>

<p>Now, the theory doesn't mean that those specific seats move hand, as some seats might deepen their lead and others
    outside of the margin might swing across. The theory states that the number of seats matters in the swing (i.e. 5
    seats of any margin, mostly marginal seats).</p>
